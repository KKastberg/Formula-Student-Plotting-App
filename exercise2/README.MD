# Exercise2
> Create a visualization app

The visualization app is started by executing `fs_plotter.py` which is a python3 script. The `assets` folder contains images used by the python script.

Images of the visualization app running can be found in the folder `example_images`.

The `fs_plotter.py` script requires some pip packages. These packages can be installed by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
